## 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I think this is one of those skills that takes time to master. As long as there is an open line of communication with the end-user, all types of changes can be implemented by way of many small and simple releases. User stories helps with streamlining client needs by asking the questions, "Who?," "What?," and "Why?."
   1. * **Who** is this change for?* 
   2. * **What** does the user want to accomplish?* 
   3. * **Why** is this change needed?*

## 2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

After learning about agile, I feel I have been equipped with the necessary tools to further my understanding of project management in various situations. As for development, I feel it's necessary to be organized and agile provides the means to be organized while being flexible and adaptable. Development teams focus more on value-based development and are not bound to time constraints which helps to consistently deliver on end-user goals. I hope to incorporate software tools like Azure, Jira and Github to my future projects. In addition, daily stand up meetings and planning poker have become "favorites' in my developer toolkit. Agile takes the overwhelming feeling out of large development projects and helps narrow the focus down to smaller tasks so that by the end you have a stable product. As the saying goes "Slow and Steady wins the race!"


## 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think this is very important and a lesson I learned while attending a full-stack development bootcamp. There are many different personalities in a team. There will be a lot of opinions and it's important to remember that you're on the team with the same goal. This isn't about who's a better developer or who has the most experience. The goal is to deliver a product. Agile promotes itself as being a highly adaptable process and so the developers have to be adaptable as well. Team members have to be open to ideas outside of their own and be able to acknowledge differences of opinion. As the team lead of my development project at the bootcamp, I made sure to give the entire team a voice and whether we agreed or disagreed each team member had an idea implemented in the project. I think trust is important to building team morale and strengthening relationships within the team. Personal development is also important because without the experience to create, growth is halted.
